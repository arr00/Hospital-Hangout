# Hospital Hangout

We know that patients in hospitals are often lonely, and oftentimes have treatment and recovery schedules that doesn't allow much time for volunteers to see them. We designed an iOS app that allows for volunteers to see which patients in a hospital are available and want to be cheered up.
